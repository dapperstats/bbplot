Description: Provides additional flexibility and power to R graphics via the base R plotting functionality provided by the graphics and grDevices packages loaded by default with R. The functions are designed to specifically mimic the base plotting functions in the R API (e.g., have the same variable inputs named the same and in the same order) as well as in function-level syntax. The package follows the painters model of R graphics, where output production occurs in steps that are placed with subsequent steps being layered on top of earlier steps.
